# NeoChat Project Instructions

This is a real-time chat application built with the following tech stack:

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Encryption**: CryptoJS for message encryption

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React functional components with hooks
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

## Project Features
- User authentication and authorization
- Real-time messaging with Socket.io
- Message encryption for security
- Read receipts and online status
- Group chat and direct messaging
- Typing indicators
- Responsive glassmorphism UI design

## Key Design Patterns
- Context API for state management
- Component-based architecture
- RESTful API design
- Socket.io event-driven communication
- JWT-based authentication flow

## Security Considerations
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Message encryption/decryption
- JWT token validation
- Input sanitization
- CORS configuration

When writing code for this project, prioritize:
1. Type safety with TypeScript
2. Real-time functionality
3. Security best practices
4. Clean, maintainable code
5. Responsive design principles
